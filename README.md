# üè¶ Credit Risk Prediction Application

A machine learning-powered web application for real-time credit risk assessment.

-----

## üåü 1. Short Description

This project provides an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** to predict the credit risk of a loan applicant. It utilizes a pre-trained **Extra Trees Classifier** model, trained on the **German Credit Data** dataset, to classify new applicants as having a **Good** (Lower Risk) or **Bad** (Higher Risk) credit profile.

## üéØ 2. Problem Statement

Financial institutions and banks face the crucial challenge of accurately assessing the risk associated with lending capital. Inaccurate credit decisions can lead to significant financial losses from defaults. This project addresses this by developing a robust, transparent Machine Learning model to automate and optimize the credit risk evaluation process, enabling faster and more informed lending decisions.

## ‚ú® 3. Features

  * **Interactive Streamlit UI:** A user-friendly interface for inputting applicant details.
  * **Real-Time Prediction:** Instantaneous credit risk prediction (**Good** or **Bad**) upon clicking the 'Predict' button.
  * **Extra Trees Classifier:** A high-performance ensemble model is used as the core predictive engine.
  * **Data Visibility:** Displays the encoded input data in a pandas DataFrame to show the exact values fed into the model.
  * **Categorical Encoding:** Uses pre-fitted `LabelEncoder` objects for consistent feature transformation.
